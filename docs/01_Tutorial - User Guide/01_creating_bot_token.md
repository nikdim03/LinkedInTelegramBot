# How to Get Your Bot Token

To set up a new bot, you will need to talk to BotFather. No, he’s not a person – he’s also a bot, and he's the boss of all the Telegram bots.

1. Search for @botfather in Telegram.

3. Type `/newbot`, and follow the prompts to set up a new bot. The BotFather will give you a token that you will use to authenticate your bot and grant it access to the Telegram API.

!!! warning "Be Careful"
    Make sure you store the token securely. Anyone with your token access can easily manipulate your bot.
