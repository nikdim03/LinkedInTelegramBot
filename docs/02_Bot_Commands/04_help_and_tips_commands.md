# The Help And Tips Commands

## The Owner Help Command

If you are the owner of the bot you can send a `/help` command in the private chat with the bot or in a group a bot is in, and the bot will reply with a message containing all the commands you as an (Owner) can use.

!!! note 
    The reply to the `/help` command will differ to group admins and normal group members.
    Only the bot's owner set in the [bot configuration .env file](../01_Tutorial%20-%20User%20Guide/03_configuring_bot.md) will get the command list help message.
